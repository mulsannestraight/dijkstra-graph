# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

A graph implementation of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.
The application will read the inputs from a file called `city.txt`, which contains the source destinations, target destinations, and the distances between each city. An example of `city.txt` may look like this:
```
a     b     9
a     c     5
a     e     4
b     a     1
b     d     2
```
The first column indicates the names of source destinations. The second column indicates the target destinations. The third column indicates the distances between each source destination and target destination.
